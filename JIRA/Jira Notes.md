## Notes

### Agile

Agile is a Project Management Approach to deliver the product _continuously_

It's the contrary of a waterfall model, which each phase need to be completed to start the next phase

### JIRA

We Created a Project for Software Development with Scrum Template (in a Team-Managed Type)

#### Filters - Issue Types:

    1. EPIC - Big abstract view of the work, which can be broken in User Stories

    2. User Stories - "As a [persona], I [want to], [so that]" - This will be broken in Tasks

        - Persona: Who are we building this for
        - Want To: What is their intend?
        - So that: Whats the bigger picture of the problem to be solved

        - E.G.: as a user, I want to save my profile, so that when I login the app knows my personal needs.

    3. Task - It's the specific task that must be done

#### Apps

Jira has over 1000 apps integrations

#### Scrum Roles

Project Owner > Scrum Master > Scrum Team (Developers)

#### Creating Issues

Creating Stories

    - For each story, attention to the Story point Estimate (duration / difficulty of each story)

    - In each story there's the "Child Issues" (which are the tasks)
        - Logo on top

#### Sprint

A time boex-period with a specific goal and outcome

We can them move the Stories we want to a specific sprint, which will have a predetermined time to start and end

As you create he sprint, there'll be created a Kanban workflow with the stories to be followed-up

Then we set Sprint Completed

#### Automation Feature (thunder logo on the sprint screen)

We add a trigger and an action

e.g.: When a new issue is started, the PO will get an email
